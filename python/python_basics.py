# Basic Input Output

a = input()   # used to accept a string input
print(a) # used for printing


# Basic Data Types in Python

a = 10              # an integer assignment
b = 10.0            # a floatinng point 
name = "John Doe"   # A string

print(a)
print(b)
print(name)

a = b = c = 1       # multiple assignments
print(a,b,c)

# Basic Arithematic Operations

a = 10
b = 20

c = a + b           # for adding two numbers
print(c)

d = b - a           # to subtract two numbers
print(d)

e = a * b           # for multiplying two numbers
print(e)

f = a/b             # to divide two numbers which returns answer in decimal point
print(f)

g = a//b            # to divide two numbers which returns answer as integer
print(g)

p = a**b            # for a raise to the power of b
print(p)

# String introduction
s = "hello world"   
print(s[:6])       # string slicing

print(s[:-2])      # string slicing from end

print( s**2)       # print same string two times

print(s+"s")       # joining two strings
